# web-dev-templates
Various templates for react web devs. Curated templates with simple and open-ended project structures.

## Why use this rather than create-react-app?
These templates are very similar to create-react-app but the reason I create these templates is because while create-react-app is helpful I'm personally not a fan of the structure it creates and for projects where a backend is required it doesn't fulfill that task.

These templates are templates I created for my own personal use and I use them on every project I make and I wanted to share them to the world!

## How to use?
1) Download the current release zip file and install it into your coding folder or wherever else you believe they can be easily accessable. 
2) Now whenever you wish to start a new project open the templates folder
3) Find the template you want to use 
4) Copy the zip file to the new folder you provisioned for your project 
5) Extract its contents (not into a new folder) into the folder 
6) Then install the packages with `npm install` 
7) Now have at it!
